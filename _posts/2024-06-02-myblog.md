Today was an exciting day not only in training but in my general life also i am happy cause i cleared my exam. I was tensed about the result for a very long time now its is cleared i can move on with my training. I have a confession to make from last 2 day i wasnt able to give my 100% to the training but now i am making a commitment to myself that i will be sencere from tomorrow. Adios
